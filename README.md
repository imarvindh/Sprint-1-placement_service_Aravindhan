# Sprint-1-placement_service_Aravindhan

This repository contains the files for the Sprint 1 placement service project by me. The project aims to create a web application that helps students find suitable internships and jobs based on their skills and preferences.

## Features

The web application has the following features:

- **Student profile**: Students can create and update their profiles with their personal details, education, skills, projects, and resume.
- **Employer profile**: Employers can create and update their profiles with their company details, contact information, and job postings.
- **Job search**: Students can search for jobs based on their skills, location, and salary preferences. They can also filter and sort the results by various criteria.
- **Job application**: Students can apply for jobs by uploading their resume and cover letter. They can also track the status of their applications and receive notifications from employers.
- **Job recommendation**: Students can receive personalized job recommendations based on their profile and preferences. They can also rate and review the jobs they applied for or are interested in.
- **Feedback system**: Employers can provide feedback to students who applied for their jobs. They can also rate and review the students they hired or interviewed.
